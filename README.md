I'm an undergraduate in Canada, studying biology. I'm researching maladaptation and local adaptation with [Jon Mee](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0688-1390) & [Sam Yeaman](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1706-8699).

# Scripting

I script in [R](https://developer.r-project.org/www.gnu.org/R.html) and [BASH ](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/).

I began programming when I learned [Blitz Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitz_BASIC) as a youngling. I learned a tiny amount of C++ in secondary school, but I didn't continue. I'm much more comfortable with interpreted languages, but I am learning Python3 and will be picking up the object-oriented aspects of it so I can write GTK applications for the [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) environment.

# My Run Commands (rc and dot files)

I'm a Linux-geek, and I use Fedora daily on my desktop; I do, however, have a MacBook (I might even dual-boot, to enjoy [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) in 4k).

I don't have anything interesting to share here. What I use is fairly stock, however, I do have some aliases for emacsclient set, but I don't remember where I got them; I didn't write it.

# Software I Like and Use

#### IDEs and Writing Environments

- [Spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org); no, [I'm not kidding](https://github.com/vsbuffalo/dotfiles/blob/dbd493ebc2d174894799dbddb7e356ae22eb85fd/.zshrc#L80-L83).
- R Studio
- Pycharm (which is also *very* nice for working with R)
- [SLiM](https://www.github.com/messerlab/slim) (which [I package for Linux using Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/bacarson/SLiM-Selection_on_Linked_Mutations/))
